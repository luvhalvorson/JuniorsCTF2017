Aliens have abducted Rick! They want to steal the receipt of the dark matter!
Near planet Earth...


- Rick, how does it feel to be at our house? Can you guess why are you here?
- You want to steal the receipt of the black matter again? I won’t tell you anything.
- You don’t have to. We’ve made up a clone of you, who will now travel to earth and Morty will give him a Flashcards with a receipt
- I guessed that it can end up like this. I’ve already sent Morty a message.
(Five minutes later)
- Our super antenna has stole your message, and in the message there is nothing about dark matter or about a clone! Soon the receipt will be in our hands
This moment on Earth...
