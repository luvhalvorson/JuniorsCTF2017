- Rick, I'm sick of school, I don't want to go there anymore.
- What's your problem? Don't go.
- But while the school exists I am required to go to school, Rick. That's in the rules!
- Well, there won't be such rule without school!
- Thanks for the idea, Rick!

A few days later, a program for solving quadratic equations appeared on all school computers.

Sounds good, but that program has one undocumented function, which allows Morty to destroy the school. Unfortunately, Morty was in great hurry and made a mistake - instead of destroying school the program will destroy whole world! Find that function and prevent Morty from completing his nefarious plan.
