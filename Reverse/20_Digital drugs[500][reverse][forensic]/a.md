-Morty, somebody threw me up a flash drive! 
With drugs! 
-Can I see it? 
-Don’t touch it! It has already been used. You will end up with cyberaids!




-I have cyberaids.

-Cool... 
-Yes, Morty. I have started to decrypt [the drugs](drugs), but I managed to upload only [this](some_files.zip). Stop being childish, Morty. Help me with that I’ve started. 
-How will it help curing the cyberaids? 
-Don’t know. Just trying to fill in some plot holes. Just do it.
