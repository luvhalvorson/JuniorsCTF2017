- Hi, Summer! Haven't you seen Rick?
- He was running around for all day with some books, muttering: 
"Rabbit's skull is shipped on a train with bugs. You can hear it’s howl. In the depth on the sunken ship a monster in a hat with feather plays on banjo, screaming “Ho-Ho-Ho! Yellow bricks!”"
By the way, he asked me to give this(key)to you.
- Did you see the books he carried?
- I think you'll find them here(library).
